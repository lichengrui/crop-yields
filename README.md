# Predicting Crop Yields

This was a project done for ISyE 6414: Regression. Please see "Crop Yields.pdf" for more information. 

## Description

Goal of this project was to use regression to predict crop yields using various features such as: 

* Average annual rainfall 
* Pesticide usage 
* Average temperature 
* Birth rate 
* Patent applications 
* Land area 
* Urban population 
* Fertility rate 
* Survival to age 65, female 
* Mortality rate, infant 
* Balance of trade 
* Population in labor force 
* Agricultural Land 
* Forest Land 
* Net migration 
* Patent Applications



## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scipy
* Statsmodels
* Scipy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn

### Executing program

* Using available data found in the "data" folder, create a concatenated dataset using the existing data by running the file "concat_data.py" or "concat_data.ipynb"
    This will create a file of your desired filename in the filepath
* Run "EDA.ipynb" to view all of the EDA done on the dataset
* Run "Regression.ipynb" to see regression analysis
